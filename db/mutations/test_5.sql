The common story is that great products live or die by their beautiful, coherent UI — but the reality is more complicated. ￼ In this video, I share the inside scoop on how generative UI, agentic software, and disposable pixels are reshaping B2B SaaS and enterprise tools: • Why coherent interfaces were an economic hack, not destiny. • How agentic layers sit over durable substrates and systems of record. • What disposable pixels mean for SaaS moats, schemas, and APIs. • Where designers, PMs, and engineers must reskill around intent. For B2B SaaS leaders and builders, the opportunity is to treat AI strategy as substrate-first and agent-ready, while the risk is clinging to pixel-perfect monoliths that agents and users will route around.\n For deeper playbooks and analysis:','\n',char(10)),'AI News & Strategy Daily | Nate B Jones','',1764529253,1573,37066,1331,191,0,'2025-12-20 07:17:09');
