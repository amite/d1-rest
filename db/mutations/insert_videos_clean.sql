RrTDp_v9V1c, Agent Zero 🤖 Projects: Better than Claude and ChatGPT?, Agent Zero 🤖 Projects: Better than Claude and ChatGPT?, Claude and ChatGPT Projects are great for conversations. But what if you need real automation with truly isolated memory and knowledge? Agent Zero Projects takes AI project management to the next level with isolated execution, project-specific memory, and complete context separation.  This is the feature you've been waiting for. Each Agent Zero Project runs in complete isolation with its own memory, knowledge base, and secrets. Your AI agent can install software, run code, and automate tasks in one project without affecting any other work.  With Agent Zero, it's "Your AI, Your Rules." As a true open-source AI agent framework, Agent Zero Projects delivers capabilities that Claude and ChatGPT simply can't match.  What makes Agent Zero Projects superior: ✅ Execution-First Architecture: Unlike Claude/ChatGPT which are primarily chatbots, Agent Zero executes. Heavy tool usage, code execution, file creation, and package installation all work seamlessly within isolated project environments. ✅ Project-Specific Memory: Your agent's memories, knowledge files, and context stay isolated per project. No mixing data between clients or workflows. ✅ Project File Structure Awareness: Agent Zero automatically shows the agent a simplified file structure of your project, eliminating the common problem where AI agents start from scratch without knowing what already exists on disk. ✅ Project-Specific Secrets: Each project can have its own API keys, passwords, and sensitive variables that  never mix with other projects or global settings. Same agent, different clients—each with their own credentials.  v0.9.7 Changelog: Major Features: - Projects Management System   - Support for custom instructions per project   - Full integration with memory, knowledge, and files   - Project-specific secrets management - New Welcome screen/Dashboard - New Wait tool for better agent control  Additional Updates: - Subordinate agent configuration override support - Support for multiple documents at once in document_query_tool - Improved context on interventions - OpenRouter embedding support - Frontend components refactor and polishing - SSH metadata output fix - Support for Windows PowerShell in local TTY utility   - More efficient selective streaming for LLMs   - UI output length limit improvements  Stop limiting yourself to chat-based "projects."

We're living in this golden age where instead of signing up for random websites, putting in your credit card, forgetting about it, and getting charged later - you can build those same tools yourself in minutes to hours. In this video, I walk you through exactly how I built a complete Media Toolkit with six powerful features using Claude Code: a video splitter, video compressor, image converter (including iPhone HEIC files), PDF merger/splitter, audio extractor, and AI image editor. I break down the exact prompts I used, show you my "baton pass" technique for managing context windows across sessions, and demo each feature live.

I’m also a Certified Personal Trainer, always busy with too many interests, and really, deeply happy with my life. I hope to be able to help others achieve these things, too. ---------------------------------------- ✉️ Contact Instagram: Twitter/X: TikTok: Leave me a comment here on YouTube!

052vzMmLoEA, How I Make Claude Code Cook, How I Make Claude Code Cook, 70% of my success happens before I write a single line of code. Here's the four-phase system I use to ship software with AI—Define, Refine, Multiply, Expand—and why most people skip the part that matters most.  I've been building code with AI exclusively for years. Today I'm pulling back the curtain on the exact workflow that makes it work: how I ideate by talking into a microphone, turn raw thoughts into PRDs with ChatGPT, use Claude Code's Plan Mode to architect implementations, and then iterate with context management, screenshots, and tests.  But the real unlock? Using Claude Code for things that aren't code at all. I'll show you how I run cloud-based agents in parallel to multiply my output, manage PRs without leaving the terminal, and transform messy data files with custom slash commands that act like research agents—working autonomously for 45 minutes while I do something else.  This is the system. Define what you want (not how). Refine with clear context and visual feedback. Multiply with async cloud agents. Expand beyond code into local file manipulation, research, and data transformation.  Tools shown: - Claude Code (terminal-based AI coding assistant) - Claude AI Tasks (cloud-based async agents) - ChatGPT (PRD generation) - CleanShot (screenshot utility) - Playwright (E2E testing)  Links: Claude Code: https://claude.ai/claude-code Claude AI: https://claude.ai  #ClaudeCode #AICoding #EngineeringWorkflow #Anthropic #VibeCoding 00:00 - Intro 00:44 - The App 01:05 - The Change 01:28 - The Walk 01:44 - 1.

20DiEFSHE14, Building AI that doesn’t break: Context & Knowledge Graphs Explained, Building AI that doesn’t break: Context & Knowledge Graphs Explained, 'Most AI Agents fail because they lack effective context management and integrated knowledge graphs. In this hands-on session, Mahesh Yadav (ex-Google, Meta, Microsoft, AWS) dives deep into **context engineering for AI agents**, showing you how to overcome the most common challenges that stall modern GenAI and agentic systems.  What you’ll learn: - Proven strategies to solve context management challenges in AI agents   - How knowledge graphs create a competitive moat and drive real business impact   - Best practices for using knowledge graphs to enable robust, scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)   - Mistakes to avoid and practical decision frameworks for choosing the right knowledge architecture   - Why the future of AI is context-aware—beyond prompts and LLMs  Fill out this form to receive invitation to All my Free Live Sessions & AI Resources: https://forms.gle/sRNjXnsurNxNAUQW7  Who should watch: Product managers, AI builders, technical leads, and anyone wanting their GenAI products to work in the real world—not just in slides.  Takeaway:   Stop building “brittle” AI products. Learn the secrets to integrating context and knowledge so your AI agents can reason, scale, and solve real user problems. Plus, get actionable tips and frameworks to bring context-driven AI to your organization today.

d40gE6bKxPk, AI Fixes My Code Better than Me Now?! (Here's How), AI Fixes My Code Better than Me Now?! (Here's How), It's true - I've figured out how to design a system so that my AI coding assistant debugs and fixes code faster and better than I can. And I do consider myself a pretty experienced software engineer.

6GUZXDef2U0, Seaborn Tutorial : Seaborn Full Course, Seaborn Tutorial : Seaborn Full Course, New Data Science / Machine Learning Video Everyday at 1 PM EST!!! [ Click Notification Bell ]  This video provides complete coverage of Seaborn with many real world examples. Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn is often used because it makes attractive visualizations and works easily with Pandas and NumPy.  While with Matplotlib you often have to write multiple lines of code to create a plot, Seaborn makes assumptions on what you want which often translates into getting the same plot with 1 line of code.  If you want a video that condenses the whole Seaborn API and all that it can do into 1 video with a ton of examples, then this video is for you.  I cover most everything you'll learn by reading the API here. Next I'll cover SciPy, StatsModels, Plotly, Cufflinks, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scrapy, Linear Algebra, Calculus and more.
