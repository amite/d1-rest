In this talk, we explore what changes when MCP-based agents move from experimentation to real-world use inside enterprises. The key insight: LLMs are better at writing code than they are at repeatedly calling tools. Architectures that lean into this reality — generating executable code, sandboxing it, and treating tools as APIs — unlock dramatic gains in efficiency, determinism, and scalability. You’ll see: • Why traditional tool-calling breaks down as agents grow more complex • How code-generation reduces token usage and improves correctness • What “real agents” look like once they leave the demo stage • Why standards like MCP matter for long-term interoperability • And what enterprises must solve next: identity, authorization, and governance As agent systems begin to act on behalf of users, organizations, and workflows, enterprise identity becomes infrastructure — not an afterthought.

This beginner-friendly tutorial walks you through building an autonomous agent that can research topics, make decisions, and complete tasks. No coding experience required. What is an AI agent? An agent is an LLM with tools that runs in a loop. Unlike ChatGPT which responds to single queries, AI agents work autonomously toward goals. They gather context, take action using tools, verify their work, and repeat until the task is complete. All without you babysitting every step. In this video, you will learn the fundamentals of AI agents and how to build your own using Claude Agent SDK. We will walk through a progressive build process, starting with simple Q&A and evolving into a fully autonomous agent. Each step adds one new concept, so by the end you will have a working agent that can handle complex tasks independently. The Claude Agent SDK is the same agent harness that Anthropic uses for Claude Code. It provides everything you need to build agents: LLM connection, tool integration, and automatic agent loop management. Whether you want to build a research assistant, travel planning agent, or custom automation, the building blocks are the same. Learn how to build with AI 🚀 Join our community: You will learn how to: - Understand what AI agents are and how they differ from chatbots - Set up Claude Agent SDK with Python (no coding experience needed) - Build a progressive agent: from simple Q&A to autonomous assistant - Add memory and conversation context to your agent - Equip your agent with tools for real-world interaction - Create the autonomous agent loop that makes it work independently - Build a working travel planning agent (or customize for your needs) ⏱ Timestamps – Introduction: Building Your First AI Agent (No Coding Required!) – Core Concept: LLM + Tools + Loop = Autonomous Agent – Deep Dive: What Makes an AI Agent Different from Chatbots? – The 4-Step Framework: From Simple Q&A to Autonomous Agent – Claude Agent SDK Overview: The Framework We''re Using Today – Agent Framework Landscape: Claude, OpenAI, LangGraph & More – Quick Setup: Installing Claude Agent SDK (Python) – Build Plan: Four Progressive Steps Explained – Step 1: Foundation - Building a Simple Q&A Agent – Step 2: Adding Memory - Making Your Agent Conversational – Step 3: Adding Tools - Giving Your Agent Real-World Capabilities – Step 4: The Agent Loop - Creating an Autonomous Agent – Recap & Next Steps: What You Built & Where to Go From Here This is video 1 in our Agent Build Series. In upcoming videos, we will cover building agents with other framworks such as OpenAI AgentKit, LangGraph, CrewAI, and deploying agents to production. We will also explore advanced patterns like multi-agent systems, persistent memory, and real-world deployment strategies. The Claude Agent SDK makes building agents simple because it handles conversation management, automatic tool-calling loops, and streaming responses.

Agent Zero Projects takes AI project management to the next level with isolated execution, project-specific memory, and complete context separation. This is the feature you''ve been waiting for. Each Agent Zero Project runs in complete isolation with its own memory, knowledge base, and secrets. Your AI agent can install software, run code, and automate tasks in one project without affecting any other work. With Agent Zero, it''s "Your AI, Your Rules." As a true open-source AI agent framework, Agent Zero Projects delivers capabilities that Claude and ChatGPT simply can''t match. What makes Agent Zero Projects superior: ✅ Execution-First Architecture: Unlike Claude/ChatGPT which are primarily chatbots, Agent Zero executes. Heavy tool usage, code execution, file creation, and package installation all work seamlessly within isolated project environments. ✅ Project-Specific Memory: Your agent''s memories, knowledge files, and context stay isolated per project. No mixing data between clients or workflows. ✅ Project File Structure Awareness: Agent Zero automatically shows the agent a simplified file structure of your project, eliminating the common problem where AI agents start from scratch without knowing what already exists on disk. ✅ Project-Specific Secrets: Each project can have its own API keys, passwords, and sensitive variables that never mix with other projects or global settings. Same agent, different clients—each with their own credentials. v0.9.7 Changelog: Major Features: - Projects Management System - Support for custom instructions per project - Full integration with memory, knowledge, and files - Project-specific secrets management - New Welcome screen/Dashboard - New Wait tool for better agent control Additional Updates: - Subordinate agent configuration override support - Support for multiple documents at once in document_query_tool - Improved context on interventions - OpenRouter embedding support - Frontend components refactor and polishing - SSH metadata output fix - Support for Windows PowerShell in local TTY utility - More efficient selective streaming for LLMs - UI output length limit improvements Stop limiting yourself to chat-based "projects."

Welcome to this video, where we dive into the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore a groundbreaking feature called Function Calling. Function Calling enables LLMs to go beyond text generation by dynamically interacting with external tools, APIs, databases, or custom functions to deliver highly tailored and actionable responses. Whether it''s retrieving real-time weather updates, performing calculations, or querying a database, Function Calling allows LLMs to extend their capabilities seamlessly, making them a central component of modern AI applications. In this video, we break down the lifecycle of a prompt when Function Calling is involved. From the moment the user sends a prompt, the LLM parses the intent, determines whether external action is required, and generates a structured "call" to the appropriate tool or function. The LLM driven system, aka middleware, or client application executes this call, retrieves the output, and passes the result back to the LLM. Finally, the LLM integrates the tool''s response into a natural language reply for the user. Understanding this lifecycle highlights the synergy between LLMs and external systems, providing a blueprint for designing intelligent, interactive workflows. We’ll also highlight exactly where in the lifecycle the function or tool is invoked and why this delegation is crucial for performance, scalability, and security. You''ll see examples of how the LLM identifies the need for a function call, how it structures the request, and how the client application manages the execution to ensure accuracy and efficiency. By the end of the video, you’ll have a clear understanding of Function Calling’s potential to supercharge your AI solutions and how to implement this powerful feature in your own projects.

Speakers: Tobias Hann Description: This hands-on tutorial explores the Synthetic Data SDK, an open-source library for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data. Tobias Hann, CEO of Mostly AI, demonstrates how AI-generated synthetic data maintains statistical properties of original datasets while removing personal identifiable information. The session covers core capabilities including training generators and quality assessment, then advances to differential privacy implementation with epsilon/delta parameters, conditional generation for data simulation, multi-table synthesis for relational databases, and fair synthetic data generation to correct biases. Participants learn practical applications through live coding with real datasets including Titanic passenger data, US Census income data, and banking transactions. The tutorial emphasizes trade-offs between privacy guarantees and data quality, showing how synthetic data enables secure data sharing, software testing, and bias mitigation in machine learning workflows. ⭐️ About PyData Berlin: Since 2014, PyData Berlin has brought together the international Python and data community.

If you''ve ever had your AI agent return the wrong information or pull irrelevant chunks from your vector database, this is the fix. Re-rankers help prioritize the most relevant chunks after your initial search, making the results dramatically more accurate. I also show you how to use metadata both when vectorizing and when retrieving, so your agents can filter and find exactly what they need with precision.

In this ~11-minute walkthrough, I’ll show you exactly how to turn your n8n instance into a first-class MCP server so you can search, execute, and even edit workflows directly from tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Claude Code. You’ll see why this native MCP layer is smoother, more stable, and way more “buttery” to work with than the open-source alternatives—especially when it comes to live-editing real production workflows. We’ll start by enabling MCP Access inside n8n, grabbing your instance-level MCP config and access token, and wiring it into Claude Desktop via a single JSON file. From there, I’ll demo how Claude can automatically discover your workflows, inspect their structure, and execute them end-to-end—complete with webhook triggers, LangChain/AI agent nodes, and responses flowing back in plain language. Then we’ll jump into Cursor, where I compare the original open-source n8n MCP with the new native instance-level MCP and show why the new one is dramatically better at editing workflows. To prove it, I intentionally build a broken chatbot workflow: a webhook → GPT-4.1 mini agent → memory → webhook response chain that’s missing critical pieces like the correct HTTP method, response mode, field mappings, and session ID wiring. Using only the n8n MCP server, I ask Cursor/Claude to execute it, watch it fail, and then let MCP iteratively patch the underlying JSON until the workflow fully runs—fixing IDs, modes, memory wiring, and credentials along the way. By the end, you’ll know how to: Turn your n8n instance into an MCP server with instance-level access Expose specific workflows (with metadata and descriptions) so AI tools reliably pick the right one Plug n8n MCP into Claude Desktop and Cursor using a simple JSON config Search, execute, and auto-debug workflows purely via MCP tools Safely use MCP-driven editing on production workflows while staying in control of what goes live If you’re using n8n as the backbone of your AI systems, this is how you connect it directly to your AI coding environment and assistants—so they can not only call your workflows, but repair and evolve them with you. ⏳', 'Mark Kashef', '', 1764367262, 686, 8690, 282, 40, 0, '2025-12-20 07:17:09');

Simplicity Principle: N8n’s visual workflow builder is powerful but dangerous—complex workflows quickly become unmaintainable. Keep workflows ruthlessly simple to ensure scalability and readability. 2. JSON as a Simplifier: Using JSON representations of workflows reduces complexity, improves accuracy, and enables LLMs to both generate and document automations more clearly. 3. Separation of Concerns: Avoid monolithic “subway map” agents; instead, break down processes into small, composable, single-purpose workflows that can be reused and debugged. 4. Team-Level Responsibility: Automation projects fail when they’re treated as private experiments. Documentation, runbooks, and patterns are essential so workflows can survive vacations and staff turnover. 5. Real-World Proof: Companies like StepStone, Border, Delivery Hero, and Vodafone demonstrate that N8n can deliver massive ROI if workflows remain focused, simple, and well-documented. 6. LLMs as Accelerators: ChatGPT, Claude, and others now reliably generate JSON configs and workflow documentation, making it easier for non-developers to build maintainable agents. 7. Strategic Adoption: AI agents are software. Non-technical teams must adopt engineering principles—simplicity, composability, and documentation—if they want to avoid burnout and failure. Quotes “We are not just configuring workflows—we are building real software, and that requires engineering discipline.” “Simplicity isn’t boring; it’s the foundation of maintainability and scalability.” “N8n is like a knife—you can use it badly and hurt yourself, or use it well and create real value.” Summary In this talk, I explain why building AI agents in N8n is both powerful and risky. The visual workflow builder makes automation accessible, but complexity quickly spirals into unmaintainable spaghetti. The key is simplicity: break problems into small, composable workflows, use JSON representations with LLMs for clarity, and always document. Real companies like StepStone, Border, and Vodafone prove the ROI of this approach. Agents should be treated as real software—team-level products that require engineering discipline. With focus, documentation, and clear design, even non-developers can build sustainable agents that deliver long-term value.

RAG Fixes LLM Blind Spots: By pairing vector search with large-language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation eliminates knowledge cut-offs, slashes hallucinations, and securely injects company data into answers. 2. Explosive Enterprise Adoption: The RAG market is climbing from today’s ~$2 B to a forecast $40 B by 2035, with roughly 80 % of enterprises choosing RAG over fine-tuning for real-time data access. 3. Data & Chunking Decide Success: Clean text, smart metadata, and overlapping semantic chunks (not model size) make or break retrieval accuracy—bad chunking is the #1 RAG killer. 4. Roadmap from Prototype to Planet-Scale: Simple FAQ bots stand up in a week, but scaling to multimodal, agentic, enterprise-grade RAG demands hybrid search, sharded vector DBs, caching, cost controls, and rigorous security/compliance. 5. Know When Not to RAG: Skip it for high-volatility data, creative writing, ultra-low-latency workflows, or tiny datasets where the next model upgrade suffices—several firms learned this the expensive way. 6. The Future Is Agentic & Connected: Million-token context windows, Model Context Protocol, and agentic planning will merge with RAG, not replace it, keeping retrieval as the precision memory layer of AI systems. Quotes: “We’re giving LLMs an open-book exam instead of a closed book, and the score difference is enormous.” “Bad chunking ruins more RAG projects than bad models—data discipline beats model size every time.” “RAG isn’t a magic bullet; use it where your proprietary data matters and skip it where the next model update will suffice.” Summary: In this video I break down Retrieval-Augmented Generation as the pragmatic fix for large-language-model blind spots. I explain how RAG pairs embeddings, smart chunking and vector search to ground answers in real data, share enterprise wins like LinkedIn’s faster support and RBC’s compliant agent assist, and map a five-level roadmap from simple FAQ bots to multimodal, agentic, enterprise-grade systems. I warn where RAG backfires—volatile data, creative writing, trivial tasks—and stress disciplined data pipelines, evaluation and security from day one. Looking ahead, bigger context windows and MCP will fuse with RAG, not replace it, keeping retrieval central to real-world AI.

What I haven’t seen a lot of though is actually using R1 in agentic workflows to truly leverage its power. So that’s what I’m showing you in this video - we’ll be using the power of R1 to make a simple but super effective agentic RAG setup. We’ll be using Smolagents by HuggingFace to create our agent - it’s the simplest agent framework out there and many of you have been asking me to try it out. This agentic RAG setup centers around the idea that reasoning LLMs like R1 are extremely powerful but quite slow. Because of this, a lot of people are starting to experiment with combining the raw power of a model like R1 with a more lightweight and fast LLM to drive the primary conversation/agent flow. Think of basically giving R1 as a tool for an agent to use when it needs more reasoning power at the cost of a slower response (and higher costs). That’s what we’ll be doing here - creating an agent that has an R1 driven RAG tool to extract in depth insights from a knowledgebase. The example in this video is meant to be an introduction to these kind of reasoning agentic flows. That’s why I keep it simple with Smolagents and a local knowledgebase. But I’m planning on expanding this much further soon with a much more robust but still similar flow built with Pydantic AI and LangGraph! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Community Voting period of the oTTomator Hackathon is open!

That’s why RAG is such a huge topic when it comes to AI right now - it’s a method for providing an LLM with external knowledge you curate so it can become an expert at something it wasn’t before - a specific AI framework, your ecommerce store, you name it. The problem is, that “curate” step can be very difficult and slow. That is where Crawl4AI comes in! Crawl4AI is an open source web crawling framework specifically designed for scraping websites and formatting the output in the BEST possible way for an LLM to understand. The best part is it solves a LOT of problems we typically have with systems that crawl websites - usually they are slow, resource intensive, and complicated. But Crawl4AI is VERY fast, intuitive, easy to set up, and extremely memory efficient. In this video, I show you how to use Crawl4AI to super easily crawl websites for LLMs in just seconds, and at the end I even show you a RAG AI agent I’ve built to be a “Pydantic AI” framework expert using Crawl4AI to build the knowledgebase. And you could really take this and use it for any website you want. Next video I''ll do a deep dive into this agent! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Register now for the oTTomator AI Agent Hackathon with a $6,000 prize pool!

Follow up video for deploying this app to the cloud! Artificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I''m on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents. In this video I show you an INCREDIBLE packaged local AI solution with Ollama for the LLMs, Qdrant for RAG, Postgres for the SQL database, and n8n for the no code workflow automations. This package is SO easy to set up and use! I walk you through the setup quick and then even show you how to use it to build a RAG AI Agent that runs entirely locally! One really important thing to keep in mind is that while I created a no code AI agent with n8n in this video, this whole local AI setup could be used to actually code your AI agents! It doesn''t have to be "no code" n8n for the actual agent. A custom coded RAG AI agent with n8n for the accompanying workflow automations (agent tools!) is another fantastic use of this local AI package. Hardware: I am actually using a laptop for this video - with a 3070 laptop GPU and an i7-12700H CPU with 14 cores and 20 threads. So nothing crazy at all! It takes up to 5 minutes for me to get a response from Llama 3.1 8b including RAG. Definitely not fast enough for a chatbot though those kind of speeds could be okay for some agentic workloads. Typically though you will want a GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM for an 8b model, and at least 16GB of VRAM for a 70b model like Llama 3.1 70b. - - Unveiling the Local AI Package - - Installing the Local AI Package - - Exploring the Docker Containers - - Creating a Local RAG AI Agent - - Testing the Local RAG AI Agent - - Outro + Future Ideas ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My version of the local AI starter kit with my improvements, as well as the template for the n8n RAG AI Agent workflow I created in the video, can be found here: Link to the Local AI Starter Kit by n8n: I recommended GitHub Desktop and Docker Desktop in the video - here are the links for both: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Join me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI.

Created in collaboration between Mistral AI and Scrimba. Code is available on the Scrimba course page for each lesson. You will learn how to build intelligent applications that span from straightforward chat completions to complex functionalities like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling. Starting off, you’ll get an introduction to Mistral''s open-source models, including Mistral 7B and Mistral 8x7B, and progress to their commercial models. You''ll gain hands-on experience leveraging the full suite of Mistral’s La Plateforme. The rest of the course is mainly focused on two essential paradigms in AI engineering: knowledge retrieval and AI agents. In the first part, you’ll learn how to split text documents with LangChain, convert them into embeddings, store them in a vector database, and finally perform retrieval. In the AI agents segment, you’ll learn how to give Mistral access to the functions within your app, and let their models decide when to call them. This skill will enable you to create a whole new type of user experience, where people can interact with your apps through conversation instead of mere clicking. Towards the end, we will also go through how you can use Ollama to easily run inference on your own computer, and use it as the backbone of any AI app you develop locally.

We created a simple prompt manager class acting as the interface to render prompts from the template folder. We can apply conditional logic for more granular control over prompts while also validating the input variables. Conditional logic in prompts enables nuanced, context-aware instructions and responses, mirroring natural conversation adaptability while reducing token usage and eliminating the need for multiple similar prompts — something I think we are going to see more often. 👋🏻 About Me Hi!

 :) --------- If you''d like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview: 1. Learn Python I recommend following the Python for Everybody specialization course on Coursera, which is one of the most popular courses there: 2. Learn SQL SQL is still the lingua franca of data. I recommend going with Learn SQL Basics for Data Science course, because it contains some chapters which are very releavant to data engineering in partcular, e.g. distributed computing with Spark 3. Learn Bash scripting/Linux I wouldn''t take a full course on it, but at least read a good article. if you do prefer to take a course/guided project, I think this one is short and good: 4. Learn how to develop on the cloud, e.g. on AWS There are a few good courses around there, but I think the Coursera one is the most comprehensive imp.i384100.net/P0MJBM Discloure: The above contain affiliate links, meaning when you click the links and make a purchase, I receive a commission!

I figured this would be a great opportunity to show off the future of AI-powered coding demonstrating how you can supercharge your software engineering skills using Copilots like Aider, and Cursor and tech like Electron and DuckDB. In our AI Devlog walkthrough, we break down how to tackle the min, mean, and max calculation challenge on a massive dataset using DuckDB. We''ll use the latest version of turbo4, an OpenAI assistants API wrapper that enables you to build knowledge bases directly from URLs. Your custom turbo4 assistant can then consume the knowledge base and generate code for you. This channel is dedicated to helping you transform from a traditional coder to an Agentic engineer, adept in leveraging the potency of AI-enhanced coding techniques and next-gen tools like the Assistants API from OpenAI to elevate your productivity and capability in the modern coding landscape. We start by setting up an Electron app and guide you through using Typescript, the Vuetify framework for Vue UI components, and DuckDB''s in-memory database for handling ONE BILLION rows of data efficiently. Our focus is on clear, applied knowledge, we don''t care about typescript types we care about learning how to build like we''re an engineer of the future. We''ll utilize Two AI Coding assistants: Aider and Cursor. We''ll talk and show what they''re both good at and where they''re weak. By following our methodical approach, you''ll learn valuable strategies for improving prompt engineering abilities and get ahead of the AI wave that''s redefining software engineering.

While most developers have internalized the rules of thumb for designing schemas for RDBMSs, these rules don''t always apply to MongoDB. The simple fact that documents can represent rich, schema-free data structures means that we have a lot of viable alternatives to the standard, normalized, relational model. Not only that, MongoDB has several unique features, such as atomic updates and indexed array keys, that greatly influence the kinds of schemas that make sense. Understandably, this begets good questions: -Are foreign keys permissible, or is it better to represent one-to-many relations within a single document? -Are join tables necessary, or is there another technique for building out many-to-many relationships? -What level of denormalization is appropriate? -How do my data modeling decisions affect the efficiency of updates and queries? In this webcast, we''ll answer these questions and more, provide a number of data modeling rules of thumb, and discuss the tradeoffs of various data modeling strategies.

For B2B SaaS leaders and builders, the opportunity is to treat AI strategy as substrate-first and agent-ready, while the risk is clinging to pixel-perfect monoliths that agents and users will route around.

In this talk, we explore what changes when MCP-based agents move from experimentation to real-world use inside enterprises. The key insight: LLMs are better at writing code than they are at repeatedly calling tools. Architectures that lean into this reality — generating executable code, sandboxing it, and treating tools as APIs — unlock dramatic gains in efficiency, determinism, and scalability.

This beginner-friendly tutorial walks you through building an autonomous agent that can research topics, make decisions, and complete tasks. No coding experience required. What is an AI agent? An agent is an LLM with tools that runs in a loop. Unlike ChatGPT which responds to single queries, AI agents work autonomously toward goals. They gather context, take action using tools, verify their work, and repeat until the task is complete. All without you babysitting every step. In this video, you will learn the fundamentals of AI agents and how to build your own using Claude Agent SDK. We will walk through a progressive build process, starting with simple Q&A and evolving into a fully autonomous agent. Each step adds one new concept, so by the end you will have a working agent that can handle complex tasks independently. The Claude Agent SDK is the same agent harness that Anthropic uses for Claude Code. It provides everything you need to build agents: LLM connection, tool integration, and automatic agent loop management. Whether you want to build a research assistant, travel planning agent, or custom automation, the building blocks are the same. Learn how to build with AI 🚀 Join our community: You will learn how to: - Understand what AI agents are and how they differ from chatbots - Set up Claude Agent SDK with Python (no coding experience needed) - Build a progressive agent: from simple Q&A to autonomous assistant - Add memory and conversation context to your agent - Equip your agent with tools for real-world interaction - Create the autonomous agent loop that makes it work independently - Build a working travel planning agent (or customize for your needs) ⏱ Timestamps – Introduction: Building Your First AI Agent (No Coding Required!) – Core Concept: LLM + Tools + Loop = Autonomous Agent – Deep Dive: What Makes an AI Agent Different from Chatbots? – The 4-Step Framework: From Simple Q&A to Autonomous Agent – Claude Agent SDK Overview: The Framework We''re Using Today – Agent Framework Landscape: Claude, OpenAI, LangGraph & More – Quick Setup: Installing Claude Agent SDK (Python) – Build Plan: Four Progressive Steps Explained – Step 1: Foundation - Building a Simple Q&A Agent – Step 2: Adding Memory - Making Your Agent Conversational – Step 3: Adding Tools - Giving Your Agent Real-World Capabilities – Step 4: The Agent Loop - Creating an Autonomous Agent – Recap & Next Steps: What You Built & Where to Go From Here This is video 1 in our Agent Build Series. In upcoming videos, we will cover building agents with other framworks such as OpenAI AgentKit, LangGraph, CrewAI, and deploying agents to production. We will also explore advanced patterns like multi-agent systems, persistent memory, and real-world deployment strategies. The Claude Agent SDK makes building agents simple because it handles conversation management, automatic tool-calling loops, and streaming responses.

Agent Zero Projects takes AI project management to the next level with isolated execution, project-specific memory, and complete context separation. This is the feature you''ve been waiting for. Each Agent Zero Project runs in complete isolation with its own memory, knowledge base, and secrets. Your AI agent can install software, run code, and automate tasks in one project without affecting any other work. With Agent Zero, it''s "Your AI, Your Rules." As a true open-source AI agent framework, Agent Zero Projects delivers capabilities that Claude and ChatGPT simply can''t match. What makes Agent Zero Projects superior: ✅ Execution-First Architecture: Unlike Claude/ChatGPT which are primarily chatbots, Agent Zero executes. Heavy tool usage, code execution, file creation, and package installation all work seamlessly within isolated project environments. ✅ Project-Specific Memory: Your agent''s memories, knowledge files, and context stay isolated per project. No mixing data between clients or workflows. ✅ Project File Structure Awareness: Agent Zero automatically shows the agent a simplified file structure of your project, eliminating the common problem where AI agents start from scratch without knowing what already exists on disk. ✅ Project-Specific Secrets: Each project can have its own API keys, passwords, and sensitive variables that never mix with other projects or global settings. Same agent, different clients—each with their own credentials. v0.9.7 Changelog: Major Features: - Projects Management System - Support for custom instructions per project - Full integration with memory, knowledge, and files - Project-specific secrets management - New Welcome screen/Dashboard - New Wait tool for better agent control Additional Updates: - Subordinate agent configuration override support - Support for multiple documents at once in document_query_tool - Improved context on interventions - OpenRouter embedding support - Frontend components refactor and polishing - SSH metadata output fix - Support for Windows PowerShell in local TTY utility - More efficient selective streaming for LLMs - UI output length limit improvements Stop limiting yourself to chat-based "projects."

Welcome to this video, where we dive into the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore a groundbreaking feature called Function Calling. Function Calling enables LLMs to go beyond text generation by dynamically interacting with external tools, APIs, databases, or custom functions to deliver highly tailored and actionable responses. Whether it''s retrieving real-time weather updates, performing calculations, or querying a database, Function Calling allows LLMs to extend their capabilities seamlessly, making them a central component of modern AI applications. In this video, we break down the lifecycle of a prompt when Function Calling is involved. From the moment the user sends a prompt, the LLM parses the intent, determines whether external action is required, and generates a structured "call" to the appropriate tool or function. The LLM driven system, aka middleware, or client application executes this call, retrieves the output, and passes the result back to the LLM. Finally, the LLM integrates the tool''s response into a natural language reply for the user. Understanding this lifecycle highlights the synergy between LLMs and external systems, providing a blueprint for designing intelligent, interactive workflows. We’ll also highlight exactly where in the lifecycle the function or tool is invoked and why this delegation is crucial for performance, scalability, and security. You''ll see examples of how the LLM identifies the need for a function call, how it structures the request, and how the client application manages the execution to ensure accuracy and efficiency. By the end of the video, you’ll have a clear understanding of Function Calling’s potential to supercharge your AI solutions and how to implement this powerful feature in your own projects.

User enters SSID and Password in a "Glassmorphism" styled form. 2. On submit, backend generates a QR code using the `qrcode` library. 3. CRITICAL: Do not save images to disk. Generate the QR code in memory (buffer) and return as a Base64 string. 4. Display the result in a printable card UI. **Deployment (Modern Approach):** * Use the `node:23` (or latest 22) Docker base image. * DO NOT include a build step (tsc). * Run the application directly using the `--experimental-strip-types` flag (e.g. `node --experimental-strip-types server.ts`). ⬅️ 🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥', 'Google Cloud Tech', '', 1765213284, 627, 66272, 2710, 254, 0, '2025-12-20 07:17:09');

Speakers: Tobias Hann Description: This hands-on tutorial explores the Synthetic Data SDK, an open-source library for generating privacy-preserving synthetic data. Tobias Hann, CEO of Mostly AI, demonstrates how AI-generated synthetic data maintains statistical properties of original datasets while removing personal identifiable information. The session covers core capabilities including training generators and quality assessment, then advances to differential privacy implementation with epsilon/delta parameters, conditional generation for data simulation, multi-table synthesis for relational databases, and fair synthetic data generation to correct biases. Participants learn practical applications through live coding with real datasets including Titanic passenger data, US Census income data, and banking transactions. The tutorial emphasizes trade-offs between privacy guarantees and data quality, showing how synthetic data enables secure data sharing, software testing, and bias mitigation in machine learning workflows. ⭐️ About PyData Berlin: Since 2014, PyData Berlin has brought together the international Python and data community.

If you''ve ever had your AI agent return the wrong information or pull irrelevant chunks from your vector database, this is the fix. Re-rankers help prioritize the most relevant chunks after your initial search, making the results dramatically more accurate. I also show you how to use metadata both when vectorizing and when retrieving, so your agents can filter and find exactly what they need with precision. These techniques are simple to implement but make a huge difference in how well your agents understand and respond.

In this ~11-minute walkthrough, I’ll show you exactly how to turn your n8n instance into a first-class MCP server so you can search, execute, and even edit workflows directly from tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Claude Code. You’ll see why this native MCP layer is smoother, more stable, and way more “buttery” to work with than the open-source alternatives—especially when it comes to live-editing real production workflows. We’ll start by enabling MCP Access inside n8n, grabbing your instance-level MCP config and access token, and wiring it into Claude Desktop via a single JSON file. From there, I’ll demo how Claude can automatically discover your workflows, inspect their structure, and execute them end-to-end—complete with webhook triggers, LangChain/AI agent nodes, and responses flowing back in plain language. Then we’ll jump into Cursor, where I compare the original open-source n8n MCP with the new native instance-level MCP and show why the new one is dramatically better at editing workflows. To prove it, I intentionally build a broken chatbot workflow: a webhook → GPT-4.1 mini agent → memory → webhook response chain that’s missing critical pieces like the correct HTTP method, response mode, field mappings, and session ID wiring. Using only the n8n MCP server, I ask Cursor/Claude to execute it, watch it fail, and then let MCP iteratively patch the underlying JSON until the workflow fully runs—fixing IDs, modes, memory wiring, and credentials along the way. By the end, you’ll know how to: Turn your n8n instance into an MCP server with instance-level access Expose specific workflows (with metadata and descriptions) so AI tools reliably pick the right one Plug n8n MCP into Claude Desktop and Cursor using a simple JSON config Search, execute, and auto-debug workflows purely via MCP tools Safely use MCP-driven editing on production workflows while staying in control of what goes live If you’re using n8n as the backbone of your AI systems, this is how you connect it directly to your AI coding environment and assistants—so they can not only call your workflows, but repair and evolve them with you. ⏳', 'Mark Kashef', '', 1764367262, 686, 8690, 282, 40, 0, '2025-12-20 07:17:09');

Simplicity Principle: N8n’s visual workflow builder is powerful but dangerous—complex workflows quickly become unmaintainable. Keep workflows ruthlessly simple to ensure scalability and readability. 2. JSON as a Simplifier: Using JSON representations of workflows reduces complexity, improves accuracy, and enables LLMs to both generate and document automations more clearly. 3. Separation of Concerns: Avoid monolithic “subway map” agents; instead, break down processes into small, composable, single-purpose workflows that can be reused and debugged. 4. Team-Level Responsibility: Automation projects fail when they’re treated as private experiments. Documentation, runbooks, and patterns are essential so workflows can survive vacations and staff turnover. 5. Real-World Proof: Companies like StepStone, Border, Delivery Hero, and Vodafone demonstrate that N8n can deliver massive ROI if workflows remain focused, simple, and well-documented. 6. LLMs as Accelerators: ChatGPT, Claude, and others now reliably generate JSON configs and workflow documentation, making it easier for non-developers to build maintainable agents. 7. Strategic Adoption: AI agents are software. Non-technical teams must adopt engineering principles—simplicity, composability, and documentation—if they want to avoid burnout and failure. Quotes “We are not just configuring workflows—we are building real software, and that requires engineering discipline.” “Simplicity isn’t boring; it’s the foundation of maintainability and scalability.” “N8n is like a knife—you can use it badly and hurt yourself, or use it well and create real value.” Summary In this talk, I explain why building AI agents in N8n is both powerful and risky. The visual workflow builder makes automation accessible, but complexity quickly spirals into unmaintainable spaghetti. The key is simplicity: break problems into small, composable workflows, use JSON representations with LLMs for clarity, and always document. Real companies like StepStone, Border, and Vodafone prove the ROI of this approach. Agents should be treated as real software—team-level products that require engineering discipline. With focus, documentation, and clear design, even non-developers can build sustainable agents that deliver long-term value.

RAG Fixes LLM Blind Spots: By pairing vector search with large-language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation eliminates knowledge cut-offs, slashes hallucinations, and securely injects company data into answers. 2. Explosive Enterprise Adoption: The RAG market is climbing from today’s ~$2 B to a forecast $40 B by 2035, with roughly 80 % of enterprises choosing RAG over fine-tuning for real-time data access. 3. Data & Chunking Decide Success: Clean text, smart metadata, and overlapping semantic chunks (not model size) make or break retrieval accuracy—bad chunking is the #1 RAG killer. 4. Roadmap from Prototype to Planet-Scale: Simple FAQ bots stand up in a week, but scaling to multimodal, agentic, enterprise-grade RAG demands hybrid search, sharded vector DBs, caching, cost controls, and rigorous security/compliance. 5. Know When Not to RAG: Skip it for high-volatility data, creative writing, ultra-low-latency workflows, or tiny datasets where the next model upgrade suffices—several firms learned this the expensive way. 6. The Future Is Agentic & Connected: Million-token context windows, Model Context Protocol, and agentic planning will merge with RAG, not replace it, keeping retrieval as the precision memory layer of AI systems. Quotes: “We’re giving LLMs an open-book exam instead of a closed book, and the score difference is enormous.” “Bad chunking ruins more RAG projects than bad models—data discipline beats model size every time.” “RAG isn’t a magic bullet; use it where your proprietary data matters and skip it where the next model update will suffice.” Summary: In this video I break down Retrieval-Augmented Generation as the pragmatic fix for large-language-model blind spots. I explain how RAG pairs embeddings, smart chunking and vector search to ground answers in real data, share enterprise wins like LinkedIn’s faster support and RBC’s compliant agent assist, and map a five-level roadmap from simple FAQ bots to multimodal, agentic, enterprise-grade systems. I warn where RAG backfires—volatile data, creative writing, trivial tasks—and stress disciplined data pipelines, evaluation and security from day one. Looking ahead, bigger context windows and MCP will fuse with RAG, not replace it, keeping retrieval central to real-world AI.

What I haven’t seen a lot of though is actually using R1 in agentic workflows to truly leverage its power. So that’s what I’m showing you in this video - we’ll be using the power of R1 to make a simple but super effective agentic RAG setup. We’ll be using Smolagents by HuggingFace to create our agent - it’s the simplest agent framework out there and many of you have been asking me to try it out. This agentic RAG setup centers around the idea that reasoning LLMs like R1 are extremely powerful but quite slow. Because of this, a lot of people are starting to experiment with combining the raw power of a model like R1 with a more lightweight and fast LLM to drive the primary conversation/agent flow. Think of basically giving R1 as a tool for an agent to use when it needs more reasoning power at the cost of a slower response (and higher costs). That’s what we’ll be doing here - creating an agent that has an R1 driven RAG tool to extract in depth insights from a knowledgebase. The example in this video is meant to be an introduction to these kind of reasoning agentic flows. That’s why I keep it simple with Smolagents and a local knowledgebase. But I’m planning on expanding this much further soon with a much more robust but still similar flow built with Pydantic AI and LangGraph! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The Community Voting period of the oTTomator Hackathon is open!

That’s why RAG is such a huge topic when it comes to AI right now - it’s a method for providing an LLM with external knowledge you curate so it can become an expert at something it wasn’t before - a specific AI framework, your ecommerce store, you name it. The problem is, that “curate” step can be very difficult and slow. That is where Crawl4AI comes in! Crawl4AI is an open source web crawling framework specifically designed for scraping websites and formatting the output in the BEST possible way for an LLM to understand. The best part is it solves a LOT of problems we typically have with systems that crawl websites - usually they are slow, resource intensive, and complicated. But Crawl4AI is VERY fast, intuitive, easy to set up, and extremely memory efficient. In this video, I show you how to use Crawl4AI to super easily crawl websites for LLMs in just seconds, and at the end I even show you a RAG AI agent I’ve built to be a “Pydantic AI” framework expert using Crawl4AI to build the knowledgebase. And you could really take this and use it for any website you want. Next video I''ll do a deep dive into this agent! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Register now for the oTTomator AI Agent Hackathon with a $6,000 prize pool!

Follow up video for deploying this app to the cloud! Artificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I''m on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents. In this video I show you an INCREDIBLE packaged local AI solution with Ollama for the LLMs, Qdrant for RAG, Postgres for the SQL database, and n8n for the no code workflow automations. This package is SO easy to set up and use! I walk you through the setup quick and then even show you how to use it to build a RAG AI Agent that runs entirely locally! One really important thing to keep in mind is that while I created a no code AI agent with n8n in this video, this whole local AI setup could be used to actually code your AI agents! It doesn''t have to be "no code" n8n for the actual agent. A custom coded RAG AI agent with n8n for the accompanying workflow automations (agent tools!) is another fantastic use of this local AI package. Hardware: I am actually using a laptop for this video - with a 3070 laptop GPU and an i7-12700H CPU with 14 cores and 20 threads. So nothing crazy at all! It takes up to 5 minutes for me to get a response from Llama 3.1 8b including RAG. Definitely not fast enough for a chatbot though those kind of speeds could be okay for some agentic workloads. Typically though you will want a GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM for an 8b model, and at least 16GB of VRAM for a 70b model like Llama 3.1 70b. - - Unveiling the Local AI Package - - Installing the Local AI Package - - Exploring the Docker Containers - - Creating a Local RAG AI Agent - - Testing the Local RAG AI Agent - - Outro + Future Ideas ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ My version of the local AI starter kit with my improvements, as well as the template for the n8n RAG AI Agent workflow I created in the video, can be found here: Link to the Local AI Starter Kit by n8n: I recommended GitHub Desktop and Docker Desktop in the video - here are the links for both: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Join me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI.

Created in collaboration between Mistral AI and Scrimba. Code is available on the Scrimba course page for each lesson. You will learn how to build intelligent applications that span from straightforward chat completions to complex functionalities like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling. Starting off, you’ll get an introduction to Mistral''s open-source models, including Mistral 7B and Mistral 8x7B, and progress to their commercial models. You''ll gain hands-on experience leveraging the full suite of Mistral’s La Plateforme. The rest of the course is mainly focused on two essential paradigms in AI engineering: knowledge retrieval and AI agents. In the first part, you’ll learn how to split text documents with LangChain, convert them into embeddings, store them in a vector database, and finally perform retrieval. In the AI agents segment, you’ll learn how to give Mistral access to the functions within your app, and let their models decide when to call them. This skill will enable you to create a whole new type of user experience, where people can interact with your apps through conversation instead of mere clicking. Towards the end, we will also go through how you can use Ollama to easily run inference on your own computer, and use it as the backbone of any AI app you develop locally.

We created a simple prompt manager class acting as the interface to render prompts from the template folder. We can apply conditional logic for more granular control over prompts while also validating the input variables. Conditional logic in prompts enables nuanced, context-aware instructions and responses, mirroring natural conversation adaptability while reducing token usage and eliminating the need for multiple similar prompts — something I think we are going to see more often. 👋🏻 About Me Hi!

This talk will review some of the most common beginner pitfalls that can cause otherwise perfectly good Pandas code to grind to a screeching halt, and walk through a set of tips and tricks to avoid them. Using a series of examples, we will review the process for identifying the elements of the code that may be causing a slowdown, and discuss a series of optimizations, ranging from good practices of input data storage and reading, to the best methods for avoiding inefficient iterations, to using the power of vectorization to optimize functions for Pandas dataframes.

 :) --------- If you''d like to learn data engineering, I recommend following the 4 simple steps below to land you the first job interview: 1. Learn Python I recommend following the Python for Everybody specialization course on Coursera, which is one of the most popular courses there: 2. Learn SQL SQL is still the lingua franca of data. I recommend going with Learn SQL Basics for Data Science course, because it contains some chapters which are very releavant to data engineering in partcular, e.g. distributed computing with Spark 3. Learn Bash scripting/Linux I wouldn''t take a full course on it, but at least read a good article. if you do prefer to take a course/guided project, I think this one is short and good: 4. Learn how to develop on the cloud, e.g. on AWS There are a few good courses around there, but I think the Coursera one is the most comprehensive imp.i384100.net/P0MJBM Discloure: The above contain affiliate links, meaning when you click the links and make a purchase, I receive a commission!

I figured this would be a great opportunity to show off the future of AI-powered coding demonstrating how you can supercharge your software engineering skills using Copilots like Aider, and Cursor and tech like Electron and DuckDB. In our AI Devlog walkthrough, we break down how to tackle the min, mean, and max calculation challenge on a massive dataset using DuckDB. We''ll use the latest version of turbo4, an OpenAI assistants API wrapper that enables you to build knowledge bases directly from URLs. Your custom turbo4 assistant can then consume the knowledge base and generate code for you. This channel is dedicated to helping you transform from a traditional coder to an Agentic engineer, adept in leveraging the potency of AI-enhanced coding techniques and next-gen tools like the Assistants API from OpenAI to elevate your productivity and capability in the modern coding landscape. We start by setting up an Electron app and guide you through using Typescript, the Vuetify framework for Vue UI components, and DuckDB''s in-memory database for handling ONE BILLION rows of data efficiently. Our focus is on clear, applied knowledge, we don''t care about typescript types we care about learning how to build like we''re an engineer of the future. We''ll utilize Two AI Coding assistants: Aider and Cursor. We''ll talk and show what they''re both good at and where they''re weak. By following our methodical approach, you''ll learn valuable strategies for improving prompt engineering abilities and get ahead of the AI wave that''s redefining software engineering.

While most developers have internalized the rules of thumb for designing schemas for RDBMSs, these rules don''t always apply to MongoDB. The simple fact that documents can represent rich, schema-free data structures means that we have a lot of viable alternatives to the standard, normalized, relational model. Not only that, MongoDB has several unique features, such as atomic updates and indexed array keys, that greatly influence the kinds of schemas that make sense. Understandably, this begets good questions: -Are foreign keys permissible, or is it better to represent one-to-many relations within a single document? -Are join tables necessary, or is there another technique for building out many-to-many relationships? -What level of denormalization is appropriate? -How do my data modeling decisions affect the efficiency of updates and queries? In this webcast, we''ll answer these questions and more, provide a number of data modeling rules of thumb, and discuss the tradeoffs of various data modeling strategies.
